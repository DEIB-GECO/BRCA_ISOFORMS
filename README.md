# Machine Learning applications for the classification of Breast Cancer Types and the Analysis of Transcript Isoform RNA-seq Data

## Description

The goal of this project is understanding if the use of *transcript isoform expression data*  are relevant for the classification of *Breast Cancer intrinsic subtypes*. In order to address this task, many different data science and machine learning techniques are explored for classification, data preprocessing, feature analysis and selection.

In order to assess the contribution of different isoforms in the crucial clinical issue of prognostically relevant breast cancer patientsâ€™ stratification, a final comparison of performances of the explored models is done on both the datasets with isoforms and genes expressions as features.
